# State System Redesign - January 2025

## Objective
Redesign PlayerState system to honestly represent all internal states including crossfade scenarios.

## Problem
Current 6-state PlayerState enum doesn't expose crossfade states, causing:
- Validation failures during crossfade pause
- UI can't show "Crossfading..." status
- Resume logic can't distinguish normal pause from crossfade pause

## Approach
Complete redesign with no backward compatibility constraints.
