# RemoteCommandManager Nonisolated(unsafe) Fix

## Problem
When `RemoteCommandManager.init()` was marked as `nonisolated`, it could not mutate MainActor-isolated properties `commandCenter` and `nowPlayingCenter`.

## Error Messages
```
Main actor-isolated property 'commandCenter' can not be mutated from a nonisolated context
Main actor-isolated property 'nowPlayingCenter' can not be mutated from a nonisolated context
Mutation of this property is only permitted within the actor
```

## Solution
Mark properties as `nonisolated(unsafe)` since they hold references to thread-safe singleton instances.

```swift
@MainActor
final class RemoteCommandManager {
    // Before
    private let commandCenter: MPRemoteCommandCenter  // ❌ MainActor-isolated
    private let nowPlayingCenter: MPNowPlayingInfoCenter  // ❌ MainActor-isolated
    
    // After
    nonisolated(unsafe) private let commandCenter: MPRemoteCommandCenter  // ✅
    nonisolated(unsafe) private let nowPlayingCenter: MPNowPlayingInfoCenter  // ✅
    
    nonisolated init() {
        // Now can assign in nonisolated init
        self.commandCenter = MPRemoteCommandCenter.shared()
        self.nowPlayingCenter = MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default()
    }
}
```

## Why This Is Safe

### Thread Safety
- `MPRemoteCommandCenter.shared()` returns a thread-safe singleton
- `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.default()` returns a thread-safe singleton
- Both are designed by Apple to be safely accessed from any thread
- Their methods are internally synchronized

### Usage Pattern
- Properties are only assigned in `init()` (immutable after construction)
- All methods that use these properties are @MainActor isolated
- No concurrent mutation possible

### nonisolated(unsafe) Semantics
Tells Swift compiler:
- "I know this property crosses isolation boundaries"
- "I take responsibility for thread safety"
- "Trust me, the underlying object is thread-safe"

Use only when you're certain the object is thread-safe!

## Build Verification
After this fix:
```bash
swift build
```

Should compile with:
- ✅ No "can not be mutated from nonisolated context" errors
- ✅ RemoteCommandManager successfully initializes from actor context
- ✅ All MainActor methods can safely use commandCenter and nowPlayingCenter
